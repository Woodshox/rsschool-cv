## Example code from codewars



**Task6 kyu:**
#### Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

 Examples:
 ```
  16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2
```
____


 Solution

```
func digitalRoot(of number: Int) -> Int {
    return (1 + (number - 1) % 9)
}
```
